# Music Theory Exercices

A website containing music theory and solfeggio exercises


## Content

This repository was first created as an HTML, PHP, CSS and JS playground, in a view of creating a website that allows people to train for typical solfeggio exams. It contains several parts, and all of them have a theory, training and exercise section. These parts are about intervals, chords, cadences, scales and rhythms.

It is possible to press buttons to hear sounds, or to answer questions in the exercise sections. It is always possible to hear again the sound, also in case it wasn't loaded properly, and as many times the user wants. 

Some improvements will be added in the near future, but this first version already works perfectly fine.

Sounds are coming from GarageBand, and illustrations were produced using MuseScore.
